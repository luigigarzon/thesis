Abstract

The Synthetic Control Method (SC), originally proposed in Abadie et al. (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010), has been frequently adopted in empirical researches in the fields of the social sciences due to its usefulness for estimating causal effects under the existence of a single treated unit. This method allows the researcher to create a counterfactual by weighting the non-treated units, while the estimation of these weights is done by a data-driven process. In this article, I document and analyze how the applied literature in SC has shaped itself throughout the years. I investigate several aspects regarding the estimation of the counterfactual across 43 different articles, besides verifying if the applied researchers are employing the most recent techniques developed by the theoretical literature. Lastly, I provide two replications to emphasize and illustrate some of the common problems of the applied literature in synthetic controls.
